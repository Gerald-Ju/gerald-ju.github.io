                    Applications Studio B gave us the opportunity to explore an idea given to us and
                    create a product from, the Council Reporting Application. It also gave me the chance to become a leader in the project which I hadn't done since my first year, writing basic C programs. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our task was created by Don Bone and as a product, would be a software system to collect incident reports from residents and solve them. With it, we came together as a group to create a concept that worked using our knowledge of Python, Java and website development/android application development resulting in a product that we ended up being pleased about, regardless of the fact that we still had things that we wanted to add and change.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a group, we decided on a website and android application interface for this project for both familiarity as well as to explore something new. As I had already had some knowledge in creating websites, I decided to try something new in creating an android app using Android Studio. As you can see from these photos, the UI looked terrible, but it worked. As long as you didn't trigger any of the numerous bugs that I couldn't get around to squashing that is.
