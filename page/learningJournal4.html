                <h2 class="homepage-description1">My Future Goals and a Lifeterm of Learning</h2>

                <p>My short term goals include website creation and upgrading my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while also learning more about ReactJS. The reason for this is for future employability with these extra skills, and because many of my university projects recently need some kind of website to display project results.</p>

                <p>Another short term goal that will eventually turn into a long term goal is to get into machine learning as it relates more towards my degree and is currently a large factor now in companies which also directly affects consumers.</p>

                <p>Some medium goals are finally completing my 5 year university degree. That includes this current semester and 1 semester completing my final research capstone project. More information that <a class="projects-hyperlink" href="../page/projectThree.html">here</a>.</p>

                <p>And as a continuation from learning machine learning, another medium goal is that I plan to look for job this year, no more internships. A job that where I will get paid for what I can deliver. As for what happens after that, I'm not sure but I am sure that the skills that I learned will absolutely be useful in the future.</p>

                <br></br>

                <p>I also regularly read online journals and publications related to data engineering and machine learning such as the series â€œAudio Deep Learning Made Simple" which includes: <a class="projects-hyperlink" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/audio-deep-learning-made-simple-part-1-state-of-the-art-techniques-da1d3dff2504">"State-of-the-Art-Techniques"</a>, 

                <a class="projects-hyperlink" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/audio-deep-learning-made-simple-part-2-why-mel-spectrograms-perform-better-aad889a93505">"Why Mel Spectrograms perform better"</a>, 

                <a class="projects-hyperlink" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/audio-deep-learning-made-simple-part-3-data-preparation-and-augmentation-24c6e1f6b52">"Data Preparation and Augmentation"</a> and  
                
                <a class="projects-hyperlink" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/audio-deep-learning-made-simple-part-3-data-preparation-and-augmentation-24c6e1f6b52">"Data Preparation and Augmentation"</a> to name a few.</p>

                <p>Machine learning courses are a dime a dozen these days, and I'm currently following different ones concurrently to suit my needs. The one I am currently following is called the <a class="projects-hyperlink" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-cardio-of-audio-cbe310d94b48">The Cardio of Audio</a>.</p>

                <p>I often see my father studying new computer software and discoveries relating to the Information Technology even now, at 60 years of age, to keep up to date. It is both blessing and a curse I think, to be able to see all the new advances in technology, but feel like some time was wasted in learning the old technogies. I can already see myself in the future, reading new advances in the machine learning sphere thinking about the me right now.</p>

                <h2 class="homepage-description1">Commitment and Contribution to the Professional Engineering Community</h2>

                <p>I have actively participated on online forums such as the <a class="projects-hyperlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/">r/dataengineering</a> and <a class="projects-hyperlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/t/computer_science/">r/computerscience</a> reddit pages which are dedicated to the topics of data engineering and computer science. This has helped me gain advice from experienced experts in the field and discuss with other learners of these subjects like myself.</p>

                <p>As far as I'm aware there aren't any large data engineering communities out there but if there are, I'll definitely be there to check them out.</p>
