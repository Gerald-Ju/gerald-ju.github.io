                <p>Engineering practice has a wide variety of meanings to each individual. I currently believe that the two pictures represent engineering practice, however I’m sure that it they will change as I progress further into my career. </p>

                <p>The first photo is quite clearly maths. Mathematics has been apart of my and everyone else’s lives for a very long time, an integral part. We start as young children learn the basics of addition and subtraction in primary school and progress to algebra and graphs in high school. Even now in university, as a first-year maths modelling 1 and 2 as well as physical modelling has been a large part of my life. A largely unpleasant part of my life but a part of my life nonetheless and it will continue to do so.</p>

                <p>Maths is essential to engineers as it forms the basis of what we do whether it be measuring the length of a gap over a bridge or calculating the information from signals in sin waves. As a data engineer it maths is often used, but not limited to, calculate the information from big data and transform them into usable English words for engineers and data analysists to understand.</p>

                    <img class="learning-html-page-img5" src="../images/code.jpg">

                </div>

                <p>My other photo is a picture of code. Code, while not have been around for as long as maths has been around for longer than I’ve been alive so to me it has been around for a long time. In fact, it’s older that my father who has been in the IT industry himself for more than 30 years. I’ve been introduced to writing code as a freshman at university learning the fundamentals of C as well as some dabbling in MATLAB and python.</p>

                <p>Coding is also an integral part of being a data engineer. Unlike maths which is used by everyone coding is more a niche in the wide range of different engineering jobs however it doesn’t make it less valuable. The computers, the phones and the all-important internet that allows those around the world to connect to each other is all coded by people. I believe that while coding is initially easy to learn the basics of, it is hard to master in its entirety as there are so many different things to learn. It’s often compared to learning new languages and with time and effort the colloquialism will come naturally. For me? Well its simply the effort I need to put in that’s holding me back.</p>
