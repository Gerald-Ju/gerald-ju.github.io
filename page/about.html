                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>A 24 year old data engineer that took the "Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) & Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice" at the University of Technology Sydney.<p>  

                <p>I've always enjoyed using computers as a child as my father has been in the IT field for 30+ years. I've followed his footsteps into the technology field and have coded many things over the years during my time in uni, such as the this very website that you are looking at right now. You can check out more at <a href="../index.html#projects" class="projects-hyperlink">Projects</a> or my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Gerald-Ju?tab=repositories" class="projects-hyperlink">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

                <p>For extracurricular activities, as a uni student, I felt obligated to join a club. I swam for 6 years at Sydney Olympic Park before halting during my Year 12 period to study for the HSC so I had planned to join the swimming club at UTS.</p>
                
                <p>However, as I walked around during Orientation Week, I spotted a booth for the UTS Kendo Club. Kendo is a traditional Japanese martial art, descended from real swordsmanship and currently uses long bamboo swords and protective armour. Pretty awesome I thought. It is.</p>

            <h1>Teamwork and Leadership</h1>
            <div class="about-html-page-content">
                <p>Over the years, both within university and throughout my internships, teamwork has been an integral part of getting projects done. I have been on both the leader and contributer sides of the coin, leading to a deeper understanding of the problems and benefits of both.</p>

                <p>An example of this was in my first semester in my first year, when I barely knew anything at all, I had been chosen to be the leader of the group we made. I learned a lot from that experience mostly because it was almost a complete failure. The class was about the "Fundamentals of C programming" and for our final assignment we planned to create a simple banking application.</p>

                <p>The reason I say that it was almost a complete failure was because I had written 80% of the code and report. I didn't realise it then, but I look back now and think that simply delegating tasks to each person and expecting them to do them on time, everytime was naive. By the time that I realised that some group members either didn't know how how to do their tasks or didn't want to do them, it was too late, and I had to try and make up for it myself. There were many things that could have been done, like asking every week on the progress or if there were any problems.</p>

                <p>On the flip side to this, now that I know what problems a leader has to deal with, whenever I am a contributer, I often know what needs to be done to help, and if I'm not sure on something if there are any problems on my end, I'll do something about it, whether by searching for a solution myself, or asking somebody else.</p>
