                <p>I’m outside the house. And it’s not just for university classes either. Socialising. It was a night of not getting drunk but drinking water and eating small cheeseburgers with strangers. </p>
                    
                    
                <p>The inter university networking night (IUNN) was the opportunity to network with industry leading companies as a new networker keen to make the first favourable impression on industry representatives. To me it was my first experience actually going out by myself and talking to other people and learning about the different industries such as Microsoft, Incubate, Atlassian, PwC and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Some of which I have heard of and those I haven’t. <p>

                    <p>The event started with us herded into 14 or so different groups with people from various universities and year status. I remember the girl sitting to my right being a first year at UTS while everyone else were from UNSW and second years. I had assumed that those coming had already completed at least 1 year of university and were just looking out for the opportunities now that they had settled in. But I really shocked me that this girl, a first year was already at a networking event socialising with everyone. </p>

                <p>To me this was really strange as it simply never occurred to me to do these things without being prompted. The fact that someone can go out and talk to random strangers albeit with similar interests really made me rethink just how much I don’t really talk to others outside my bubble. I regret a little at how my interaction with the world has mostly been through the internet and those friends from high school. </p>


                <p>And so, I thought to myself that I would ask the industry representatives who came to our groups exactly 3 questions each. That I would do it no matter what. Honestly these people get asked a lot of questions yet they always seem so eager to answer. I’ve realised that people want to answer your questions and that you don’t have to keep quiet in the corner hoping the time just passes by. With this I would have to agree with Medoway (2012) in that people do live in bubbles yet we can also do things outside our bubbles even if we have to make adjustments.</p>
