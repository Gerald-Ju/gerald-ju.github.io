                <p>“Does college create a happy bubble of disillusionment?” asked by Medoway (2012). As I am only myself and can therefore not speak for others, in my experience of living a life of only home and university, that I agree with Medoway’s statement that it is not a simple yes or no answer.</p>


                    <p>As a usual routine I wake up go to UTS if I have class that day and then go home to repeat throughout the week. One might think that this is in fact a happy bubble of disillusionment as I don’t have a job, I’m not working with colleagues that have deadlines due the next day. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>However, I don’t think so. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>As one goes throughout their life, they meet various people. Even if they don’t get to know them on a personal level, they might know their name, what degree they do and what they like to do as a hobby. Perhaps it may go deeper than that, they have team mates in a group project and as each person talks to each other a larger idea of them as a person appears. Adding each other on messenger and therefore passively networking. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>I myself am part of a club in UTS. The UTS Kendo Club has people like me who are currently completing degrees in UTS, have already completed degrees from UTS, have completed degrees from other universities, don’t even go to university and the list goes on. The variety is large and one can experience something different from talking to others in the club. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>I remember talking to one of the older members who dropped out of the UTS engineering degree simply because he already had a job in his preferred field and didn’t feel the need for the degree any longer. It was really startling to me as I had grown up thinking that once you finish high school you go to university to get a degree that would land you a good job. He’s currently a co-founder of a small business that is currently small but can possibly make it big in the “real world”. Just talking about how this is all happening pops the bubble of disillusionment, the real world is out there and Engineering Practice Preparation 1 is a step towards bringing university students there. </p>
